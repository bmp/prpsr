Information and Communications Technologies have changed our lives in innumerable ways. Digital solutions have both accelerated the social and economic development, as well as sharpened inequalities in the world. A [number of initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ICT4D_organizations) were set up over the years to help accelerate adoption and collectivize these efforts.

While efforts by these groups have immensely helped a number of organizations, most of the work has either been pioneered by technology companies, academic initiatives or by multilateral bodies. This of in itself is not a bad idea, however, the organizations and people working closely with problems on the ground have the best vantage point to enable this change.

In India, such organizations have followed the trends during Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, they haven't shaped the narratives or necessarily articulated the needs on the ground to lead technology development "for good". The creation of this group is an experiment to understand, explore and shape the use of Web 3.0 for Development.
