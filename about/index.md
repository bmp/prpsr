Information and Communications Technologies have changed our lives in innumerable ways. Digital solutions have both accelerated the social and economic development, as well as sharpened inequalities in the world. A [number of initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ICT4D_organizatio) were setup over the years to help accelerate adoption and collectivise these efforts.

While efforts by these groups have immensely helped a number of organisations, most of the work has either been pioneered by technology companies, academic initiatives or by multi-lateral bodies. This of in itself isn't a bad idea, however, the organisations and people working closely with problems on the ground have the best understanding to shape this progress.

In India, such organisations have followed the trends during Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, they haven't shaped the narratives or necessarily articulated the needs on the ground to lead technology development "for good". This group or collective is an experiment to understand, explore and shape the use of Web 3.0 for Development.
