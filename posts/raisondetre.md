## What?
<h5>"Participation", "Inclusive", "Equitable", "Collaboration" &amp; "Sustainable"</h5>

<p>I'd say 'motherhood and mysorepak', all of us agree that these are important principles, but the challenge is how do we get there. Pick any organisation in the <i>social</i> space and they will have one of these terms (if not more) as the founding principles. Many fol<b>x</b> have worked tirelessly to institionalise these ideas and grapple with the nuances that stem from the diverse spaces we inhabit. However, a new challenge that has been posed to all of us is a result of the increasing role technology plays in our lives. Like any other tool, technology too can be harnessed to help achieve these principles or to consolidate the power differences. As discussed in the <a href="{{ '/about/' | url }}">about us</a> page, there have been wonderful efforts in the past to make use of technology to benefit all of us.</p>

## Why? And why now?
<p>The rise of ICTs in India and the <i>hurried</i> adoption over the last two decades has caught many stakeholders offguard. Hurried, because the effects of ICTs is not uniform in a diverse society (who does it benefit and how much?), it does not always generate positive outcomes (online harassment, numerous cases of exclusion), and it does not lead to fulfilling the principles we started this discussion with. This does not mean we are advocating abandoning technology and returning to a society of <i>luddites</i>. What we need is a nuanced view of the effects technology can have on shaping our society and helping us achieve our goals. The aim of this group is to therefore build on the work of people who have tried this in the past, but for fol<b>x</b> who are embedded in societal work and collaborate across stakeholders ranging from government, academia, industry and civil society organisations.</p>

<h6>FOMO</h6>
<p>In the past, while poineering work has been carried out by many organisations in adopting and using ICTs for development, it has largely remained 'that'. While the world moved from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, most organisations were yet to even use e-mails as a practice (for good reason). When the world is not moving from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0, many organisations are now dealing with Google Forms, Docs and 'Theory of Change'. Web 3.0 is often used to collectively refer to a decentralised web which can provide for enhanced privacy and scalability. The term is often used to refer to,</p>
<code>
buzzwords={DAO, blockchain, NFT, crypto, etc.}
</code>

<p>The evidence so far suggests that all of these technologies and methods have largely done the opposite, centralised wealth and power, created spaces of harassment, and increased barriers to participation. While they have the potential to help with the 5Ps, the question that remains is how do we create functioning products, services that are beyond toy prototypes. Given the interest in using these technologies now, we have come together to understand them, shape their use in the larger world and provide support to people who would like to do so.</p>

## How?
<p>Conversations amongst a few of us has led to a demand to move this beyond phone calls, WhatsApp chats and lunch discussions. While we have started an informal group, what we have as tangible next steps are,</p>
